# Find your next project!

## The Goal

We hope this will help people find inspiration for new Go projects or to get
ideas on how they can use our libraries.

## The Concept

This is an entirely community-driven repo for members of the community to share
their project ideas. It can be something you want to build yourself or
something you want to see built. You can PR your completed projects to be
included in the repo. 

## The Flow

1. Create a discussion with a description of the project *OR* start building an
   idea that you find in a discussion.
2. Build the project
3. Create a pull request with the completed project
4. Update PR to include the libraries you used to build it (using tags)

You're also welcome to contribute ideas without building them out. We
recommend including which libraries might be used for the project so it's
easier for potential contributors to find.

## What is a "Complete" Project

A project is considered complete when:
1. It implements the minimum viable product for the idea
2. It includes a `README` with screenshots or a GIF describing the
   application's behavior
