# Find your next project!

## The Concept

This is an entirely community-driven repo for members of the community to share
their project ideas. It can be something you want to build yourself or
something you want to see built. You can PR your completed projects to be
included in the repo. 

## The Flow

1. Create an issue with a description of the project *OR* assign yourself an
   issue to build
2. Build the project
3. Create a pull request with the completed project
4. Update the issue to include the libraries you used to build it

You're also welcome to contribute ideas only. We recommend including which
libraries might be used for the project so it's easier for potential
contributors to find.

## The Goal

We hope this will help people find inspiration for how they can use our
different libraries through real projects.
